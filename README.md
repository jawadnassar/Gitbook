# Hello, World!

Welcome to my corner on the internet! This site serves as my digital book, primarily housing my  random tech notes, documenting my learning journey to pivot further into application security. I hope it proves useful to someone else as well!

If you find something inaccurate or that could be fixed, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/jawadnassar/Gitbook/pulls).
