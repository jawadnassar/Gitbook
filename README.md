# Hello, World!

Hi, I’m Jawad! I’ve been immersed in software and computers for most of my life. Currently, I’m a senior software development manager with a focus on application security. I’ve worn multiple hats in my career, from Software Developer to Platform Product Manager, Team Lead, and finally to Management.

This book contains random tech notes, documenting my learning journey to pivot further into application security. If you find something inaccurate or that could be fixed, please open a [pull request](https://github.com/jawadnassar/Gitbook/pulls).
