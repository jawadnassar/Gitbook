# PortSwigger

This section contains write-ups of different [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics) Capture the Flag challenges

&#x20;I’ll complement this with reading [The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook, 2nd Edition by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-web-application/9781118026472/). Although it’s a bit outdated (published in 2011), it is still highly recommended in the community as a valuable resource.

In addition, I’ll be following the video series by [Rana Khalil](https://www.youtube.com/c/RanaKhalil101/playlists) on YouTube. I’m a fan of her work, and I’m sure it will be very helpful to me.&#x20;
