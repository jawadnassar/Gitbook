# PortSwigger

This section contains write-ups of different [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics) Capture the Flag challenges

&#x20;I’ll complement this with reading [The Web Application Hacker’s Handbook, 2nd Edition by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-web-application/9781118026472/). Although it’s a bit outdated (published in 2011), it is still highly recommended in the community as a valuable resource.

In addition, I’ll be following the video series by [Rana Khalil](https://www.youtube.com/c/RanaKhalil101/playlists) on YouTube. I’m a fan of her work, and I’m sure it will be very helpful to me. Initially, my main focus will be placed on SQL injection, and upcoming blog posts will include PortSwigger lab write-ups.
