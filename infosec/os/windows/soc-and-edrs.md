# SOC and EDRs

### Definitions

A Security Operations Center (SOC) is the centralized unit within an organization that focuses on identifying, investigating, and responding to cybersecurity threats. It employs a dedicated team equipped with specialized technology and processes to monitor, analyze, and ensure the security of the organization's information assets around the clock.

Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is a cybersecurity solution that monitors endpoint devices (such as computers, mobile devices, and servers) to detect and respond to threats. It collects and analyzes data on endpoint activities, providing organizations with the tools to identify suspicious behavior and automate responses to mitigate potential security incidents.
