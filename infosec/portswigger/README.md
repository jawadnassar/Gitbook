This section contains write-ups of different [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/all-topics) Capture the Flag challenges

&#x20;Iâ€™ll complement this with reading [The Web Application Hackerâ€™s Handbook, 2nd Edition by Dafydd Stuttard and Marcus Pinto](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-web-application/9781118026472/). Although itâ€™s a bit outdated (published in 2011), it is still highly recommended in the community as a valuable resource.
