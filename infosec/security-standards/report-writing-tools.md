# Report Writing Tools

Note-taking is one of the most crucial skills for a pentester; at the end of the day, this is what you're being paid to deliver.

I personally have a mix of [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), and use [Flameshot ](https://flameshot.org/)for my screenshots, but this is a personal preference for anyone. Just make sure to use whatever works best for you. My decision is based on the following:

* Portability between multiple computers and operating systems
* Support for code snippets and code highlights
* Grammar mistakes highlighter
* Easy directory structure and [WYSIWYG ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)editors\


Here's a breakdown of some note-taking tool/platforms you can use:
