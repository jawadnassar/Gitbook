# exiftool

ExifTool is a powerful, open-source software tool for reading, writing, and manipulating metadata in a wide variety of files. It supports many types of metadata including EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, JFIF, and more, and works with many file formats like JPEG, TIFF, MP3, and PDF, among others.

#### Basic Usage of ExifTool

**Viewing Metadata:** To view metadata of a file, simply run ExifTool against a file:

```bash
exiftool example.jpg
```

This command will display all the metadata stored in `example.jpg`, such as camera settings, GPS location, or the time the photo was taken.

**Editing Metadata:** ExifTool can also be used to edit or add metadata. For example, to change the artist name on an image file:

```bash
exiftool -Artist="John Doe" example.jpg
```

This command sets the Artist field in the metadata to "John Doe".

**Removing Metadata:** To remove metadata from a file, you can use the `-all=` option:

```bash
exiftool -all= example.jpg
```

This command deletes all metadata from `example.jpg` while keeping the file intact.

#### Advanced Usage Examples

**Recursive Operation:** You can operate ExifTool recursively to process directories of files. For example, to extract metadata from all JPEG files in a directory and its subdirectories:

```bash
exiftool -r -ext jpg /path/to/directory
```

**Copying Metadata Between Files:** ExifTool allows copying metadata from one file to another. This is particularly useful in media workflows:

```bash
exiftool -TagsFromFile source.jpg target.jpg
```

This copies all tags from `source.jpg` to `target.jpg`.

**Exporting Metadata to a File:** You can export metadata into a readable format such as CSV or JSON, which is helpful for data analysis:

```bash
exiftool -json -GPS* -DateTimeOriginal example.jpg > output.json
```

This command extracts GPS data and the original date/time from `example.jpg` and saves it into `output.json`.

ExifTool is highly versatile for managing metadata across a multitude of media types, providing detailed control over privacy settings, data management, and digital asset management processes.
