# Nessus

Nessus is a widely-used cybersecurity tool designed for vulnerability scanning and assessing network security. Developed by Tenable Network Security, Nessus helps organizations identify and fix vulnerabilities such as software flaws, missing patches, or misconfigurations in their networks before attackers can exploit them. It features an intuitive interface and robust reporting capabilities, making it accessible for IT professionals to conduct comprehensive assessments. Nessus supports a wide range of operating systems and can scan various types of devices, making it a versatile tool for ensuring the security of both small and large networks.

#### 1. Basic Network Scan

To perform a basic network vulnerability scan with Nessus:

1. **Configure a New Scan**: Set up a new scan by choosing a template such as "Basic Network Scan."
2. **Set Target IP Addresses**: Input the range of IP addresses or specific hosts you want to scan.
3. **Run the Scan**: Execute the scan to assess the network for common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
4. **Review the Report**: Analyze the generated report to identify critical vulnerabilities and recommended remediations.

#### 2. Credentialed Patch Audit

Performing a credentialed scan allows Nessus to log into systems using provided credentials to more thoroughly assess the system:

1. **Select the 'Credentialed Patch Audit' Template**: This scan requires administrator credentials to access the system.
2. **Input Credentials**: Securely input the administrator credentials for the systems to be scanned.
3. **Define the Target**: Specify the IP addresses or hostnames of the devices.
4. **Execute the Scan**: Start the scan to check for missing patches and insecure configurations.
5. **Evaluate Findings**: The detailed report will show missing patches and configurations that need attention.

#### 3. Web Application Testing

Nessus can also be configured to perform web application scans to detect vulnerabilities in web applications:

1. **Choose a Web Application Scan Template**: Select a template focused on web applications.
2. **Configure Scan Settings**: Input the URL of the web application and other relevant settings such as authentication if needed.
3. **Run the Scan**: Initiate the scan to test for SQL injection, XSS, and other web-specific vulnerabilities.
4. **Analyze Output**: Review the vulnerabilities found and examine the detailed explanations and remediation steps.

#### 4. Compliance Checking

Nessus can assess compliance with standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and others:

1. **Select Compliance Template**: Choose a compliance template based on the standard you are auditing against.
2. **Configure the Scan**: Provide details about the network or system segment that needs compliance verification.
3. **Execute and Review**: Run the compliance scan and then analyze the report to see where the system stands in relation to the compliance requirements.

#### 5. Mobile Device Scan

To check for vulnerabilities in mobile environments:

1. **Setup Mobile Device Scan**: Use the appropriate Nessus template for mobile devices.
2. **Specify Devices**: Enter the IP ranges or specific addresses for mobile devices connected to your network.
3. **Scan and Review**: Start the scan to identify vulnerabilities related to mobile operating systems and applications.

These examples illustrate the versatility of Nessus in different environments and use cases, showcasing its ability to adapt to varying security needs of modern IT infrastructures.
