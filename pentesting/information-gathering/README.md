# Information Gathering

1. **Information Gathering:**
   * **Definition:** Information gathering is a broad term that encompasses the entire process of collecting data and details about a target, system, network, or any subject of interest.
   * **Scope:** It includes various activities such as OSINT, reconnaissance, and enumeration.
   * **Purpose:** The goal is to accumulate as much relevant information as possible to understand the target and make informed decisions.
2. **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence):**
   * **Definition:** OSINT is a specific type of information gathering that focuses on collecting data from publicly available sources.
   * **Sources:** Information is gathered from publicly accessible data like websites, social media, public records, news articles, and more.
   * **Purpose:** OSINT is often used to gather preliminary data about a target before more intrusive assessments.
3. **Reconnaissance:**
   * **Definition:** Reconnaissance, often referred to as "recon," is the process of actively seeking information about a target to identify vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors.
   * **Methods:** This can involve both passive techniques (like OSINT) and more active techniques such as network scanning or probing.
   * **Purpose:** The primary goal is to gather intelligence and gain a better understanding of the target's structure and potential weaknesses.
4. **Enumeration:**
   * **Definition:** Enumeration is a specific phase within the information gathering process, typically associated with penetration testing or ethical hacking.
   * **Scope:** It involves actively extracting information about a target's resources, such as network services, shares, users, and more.
   * **Purpose:** The objective is to identify and document specific details about the target's assets that can be used in later stages of an attack.

In summary, information gathering is the overarching process, OSINT is a specific approach that relies on publicly available information, reconnaissance involves actively seeking information about a target, and enumeration is a focused phase within this process that involves extracting specific details about the target's assets. These activities are often part of ethical hacking, penetration testing, or security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities in a system or network.
