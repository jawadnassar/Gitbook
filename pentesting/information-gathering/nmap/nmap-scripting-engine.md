# Nmap Scripting Engine

**Introduction:** Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) is a powerful feature of Nmap that allows users to extend the functionality of the tool by running scripts to perform a wide range of tasks during the scanning process. NSE scripts provide additional capabilities, including service version detection, vulnerability scanning, and more.

**Usage:**

* `-sC`: Equivalent to running default scripts
* `--script=<script(s)>`: Specify individual scripts or script categories to run
* `--script-args=<args>`: Pass arguments to scripts

**Common NSE Script Categories:**

1. **Discovery:**
   * `discovery` category includes scripts for discovering additional information about hosts.
2. **Vulnerability Detection:**
   * `vuln` category includes scripts for identifying potential vulnerabilities on scanned hosts.
3. **Service Version Detection:**
   * `version` category scripts help in identifying service versions running on open ports.

**Examples:**

*   Run default scripts against a target:

    ```bash
    nmap -sC example.com
    ```
*   Run specific script categories:

    ```bash
    nmap --script=default,vuln example.com
    ```
*   Run individual scripts with arguments:

    ```bash
    nmap --script=http-title --script-args="path=/index.html" example.com
    ```

**Custom Script Development:**

* Users can create custom NSE scripts to address specific needs.

NSE enhances Nmap's capabilities by providing a flexible and extensible framework for automating tasks during network reconnaissance and security assessments. Always use NSE responsibly and consider the impact of scripts on the target network.
