# nslookup

#### nslookup (Name Server Lookup) is a command-line tool for querying DNS servers to obtain domain-related information.

**Purpose:** nslookup is used to retrieve various DNS records, IP addresses, and domain-related details for troubleshooting and analysis.

**Key Features:**

* Retrieve DNS Records
* Obtain IP Addresses
* Query Specific DNS Servers
* Resolve Hostnames to IP Addresses
* Troubleshoot DNS Issues

**Examples:**

1.  **Basic DNS Query:**

    ```bash
    nslookup example.com
    ```

    Performs a basic DNS query for the domain "example.com," displaying information such as the authoritative DNS server and its IP address.
2.  **Reverse DNS Lookup:**

    ```bash
    nslookup 8.8.8.8
    ```

    Conducts a reverse DNS lookup for the IP address 8.8.8.8, providing the corresponding hostname.
3.  **Query Specific DNS Server:**

    ```bash
    nslookup example.com dns.server.ip
    ```

    Directs the query to a specific DNS server (replace dns.server.ip with the actual IP address of the DNS server).
4.  **Resolve IP Addresses to Hostnames:**

    ```bash
    nslookup 192.168.1.1
    ```

    Resolves the IP address 192.168.1.1 to its corresponding hostname.
5.  **MX Record Query for Email Servers:**

    ```bash
    nslookup -q=mx example.com
    ```

    Retrieves the Mail Exchange (MX) records for the domain "example.com," which indicate email server information.
