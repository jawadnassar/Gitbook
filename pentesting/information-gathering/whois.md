# Whois

* **Definition:** WHOIS reveals domain/IP details crucial for penetration testing and app security.
* **Purpose:** Uncover ownership and contact data, aiding in security assessments.
* **Info Included:** Registrant's details, registration info, and domain server data.
* **Accessibility:** Public WHOIS databases and registrar tools assist in data gathering.
* **Uses:** Resolving ownership disputes, addressing legal concerns, and checking domain availability for secure app development.
* **Privacy:** Domain privacy services obscure personal info, impacting security assessments.
* **Legal Requirements:** ICANN mandates accurate WHOIS info for robust security practices.
* **Changes:** Evolving policies balance transparency with security, impacting penetration testing strategies.



Running a WHOIS query for `jawad.ca` shows that personal information is redacted for privacy reasons. However, it can also reveal my nameservers, thereby exposing the hosting provider and/or domain name registrar.

You shouldn't stop here, using tools like [https://mxtoolbox.com/](https://mxtoolbox.com/) should help you figure out `MX` ,`A`,`TXT`  etc.. records for further enumeration

A quick dns check, reveals 4 IP addresses:

| Type | Domain Name | IP Address      |
| ---- | ----------- | --------------- |
| A    | jawad.ca    | 185.199.108.153 |
| A    | jawad.ca    | 185.199.109.153 |
| A    | jawad.ca    | 185.199.110.153 |
| A    | jawad.ca    | 185.199.111.153 |



We can perform a WHOIS query on IP addresses as well to determine the owner of `185.199.108.153`

In this case, we were able to determine that it belongs to GitHub.

```shell-session
