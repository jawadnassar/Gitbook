# openvpn

We'll connect with the **openvpn** command followed by the full name of the **.ovpn** file. We must use **sudo**, since **openvpn** requires elevated permissions.

```shell-session
kali@kali:~/offsec$ sudo openvpn universal.ovpn 
2021-06-28 10:20:12 Note: Treating option '--ncp-ciphers' as  '--data-ciphers' (renamed in OpenVPN 2.5).

```

We must leave this command prompt open. Closing it will disconnect the VPN connection.
