# Security Standards

Security controls and strategies encompass the comprehensive measures and plans put in place to protect information systems from unauthorized access, attacks, and vulnerabilities. This includes implementing policies, technologies, and practices to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems.

#### Shift-Left Security

Shift-Left Security is an approach that integrates security measures earlier in the software development lifecycle. By incorporating security considerations from the initial stages of development, organizations aim to identify and address vulnerabilities sooner, reducing the likelihood of security issues in the final product.

#### Threat Modelling and Threat Intelligence

Threat modeling involves systematically identifying and assessing potential threats to a system, application, or network. Threat intelligence refers to the analysis and understanding of current and emerging cyber threats. Together, they inform proactive security measures, helping organizations anticipate and mitigate potential risks effectively.

#### Table-Top Tactics

Table-Top Tactics involve simulated scenarios where stakeholders gather to discuss and analyze their organization's response to a hypothetical security incident. This exercise helps identify strengths and weaknesses in incident response plans and enhances the team's preparedness for real-world cybersecurity incidents.

#### Continuous Patching and Supply Chain Validation

Continuous patching is the ongoing process of applying updates to software and systems to address known vulnerabilities. Supply chain validation involves verifying the security of components and services obtained from external sources. Together, these practices contribute to maintaining a resilient and secure IT environment.

#### Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting information into a secure code to prevent unauthorized access. It plays a crucial role in protecting data confidentiality, ensuring that even if intercepted, the information remains unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.

#### Logging and Chaos Testing

Logging involves the systematic recording of events and activities within a system, providing a valuable resource for monitoring and incident response. Chaos testing, on the other hand, involves deliberately introducing faults and disruptions to a system to assess its resilience and identify potential weaknesses in security controls.

These topics collectively contribute to a robust cybersecurity strategy, emphasizing proactive measures, secure development practices, and effective response capabilities.
