# Directory Traversal

**Directory Traversal**: A critical web vulnerability enabling attackers to access files outside of the web server's root directory. It exploits inadequate validation of user-supplied file names, leading to unauthorized file system access.

**Mechanism:**

* Attackers manipulate file path inputs to traverse the server's directory structure (e.g., using `../../../../etc/passwd` to access system files).
* The attack exploits web applications that construct file paths from user input without thorough sanitization.

**Example of Vulnerable Code:**

*   Consider a PHP script where file paths are generated from user input without sufficient validation:

    ```php
    $file = $_GET['file']; 
    include('/var/www/html/' . $file);
    ```

    An attacker can manipulate the `file` parameter to traverse directories, such as `/var/www/html/?file=../../../../etc/passwd`.

**Detection Techniques:**

* **Manual Inspection**: Examine application code for instances where external input is used to construct file paths.
* **Automated Scanning**: Employ tools like Burp Suite to identify potential traversal sequences in requests.
* **Error-Based Detection**: Look for typical path traversal error messages or unexpected outputs when manipulating file path inputs.

**Common Attack Patterns:**

* Basic Traversal: Using `../` to move up in the directory hierarchy.
* Encoded Traversal: Utilizing URL or Unicode encoding to bypass naive filters (e.g., `%2e%2e%2f` for `../`).
* Nested Traversal: Combining multiple traversal sequences (e.g., `....//....//`).



**Mitigation Techniques:**

* **Input Validation**: Implement strict validation rules (e.g., regex) to filter traversal patterns.
* **Use of Absolute File Paths**: Avoid constructing file paths from user input. If necessary, map user inputs to a set of predefined paths.
* **Chroot Jail**: Execute the application in a chroot jail, limiting access to a specific part of the file system.
* **Least Privilege Access**: Run web server processes with minimal privileges to reduce the impact of a successful exploit.

**Test Case Example:**

* As a pentester, if you encounter a parameter like `?file=report.pdf`, try altering it to `?file=../../../../etc/passwd`. If the server returns system files, it's vulnerable.
* Testing should include encoded and double-encoded traversal sequences to bypass common security filters.
* You should test if you can find any ssh private keys under `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa`  download it via [`curl` ](../../infosec/os/linux/curl.md)then `ssh -i private_key -port 22 user@hostname`&#x20;

**Directory Traversal in Windows Environments:**

In Windows environments, Directory Traversal vulnerabilities manifest uniquely due to the different file system structure. Attackers might use sequences like `..\` to traverse directories, aiming to access critical system files such as `C:\Windows\System32\`. A typical attack might involve manipulating web application input to redirect or access files using patterns like `..\..\..\Windows\win.ini` or `%SYSTEMROOT%\..\..\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. Windows systems also have different character sets and path naming conventions (like using `\` instead of `/`), which can lead to variations in exploitation techniques. For instance, URL-encoded representations (`%5C` for `\` and `%2E%2E%5C` for `..\`) might be used to bypass basic input filters. When testing in Windows environments, it's crucial to consider these variations and test for both forward and backward slashes, as well as URL-encoded characters in traversal sequences. As with any system, ensuring robust input validation and implementing principle of least privilege are key to mitigating these vulnerabilities in Windows-based applications.
