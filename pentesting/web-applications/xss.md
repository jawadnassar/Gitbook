# XSS

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability in web applications where attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. There are three main types of XSS:

1. **Stored XSS:**
   * Malicious scripts are permanently stored on the target server, impacting all users who view the affected page. Example: Attacker injects a script into a comment on a website, and anyone viewing that comment becomes a victim.
2. **Reflected XSS:**
   * Malicious scripts are embedded in a URL and only affect users who click on a specially crafted link. Example: Attacker sends a phishing email with a link containing a script, and users who click on the link inadvertently execute the script.
3. **DOM-based XSS:**
   * The attack occurs in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. Malicious scripts manipulate the DOM, leading to undesired outcomes. Example: Attacker injects a script that modifies the page's content directly through client-side scripting.

Preventing XSS involves input validation, output encoding, and implementing security mechanisms like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of script injection attacks.
