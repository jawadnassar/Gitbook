# The CIA Triad

### The CIA Triad

* **Confidentiality:**
  * Limit access to authorized users.
  * Use encryption for secure data transmission.
  * Implement robust access controls to prevent unauthorized entry.
* **Integrity:**
  * Ensure data remains unaltered and trustworthy.
  * Employ checksums and hashing algorithms to detect tampering.
  * Implement digital signatures for data verification.
* **Availability:**
  * Maintain continuous access to critical systems and data.
  * Implement redundancy for fault tolerance.
  * Develop robust backup and disaster recovery plans.

**Cybersecurity Essentials:**

* Striking a balance between these principles is key.
* Ongoing assessments and adaptations are essential.
* The CIA Triad provides a solid foundation for resilient cybersecurity.





### Security **Standards and Frameworks**&#x20;

* **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):**
  * Ensures secure handling of credit card information.
  * Focuses on safeguarding cardholder data.
  * Enforced for businesses processing credit card transactions.
* **CIS Top 18 (Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls):**
  * Prioritizes cybersecurity practices for effective defense.
  * Addresses common cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
  * Provides a structured approach to enhance security posture.
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework:**
  * Developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
  * Framework for improving cybersecurity across critical infrastructure.
  * Consists of five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
* **FedRAMP (Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program):**
  * Standardizes security assessment and authorization for cloud services.
  * Ensures security controls meet federal standards.
  * Streamlines security approvals for government agencies.
* **Cyber Kill Chain:**
  * Describes the stages of a cyber attack from reconnaissance to exfiltration.
  * Helps organizations understand and prevent each stage.
  * Enhances proactive cybersecurity defense strategies.
* **ATT\&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) and D3FEND:**
  * ATT\&CK: Catalogs adversary behavior and tactics.
  * D3FEND: Complements ATT\&CK, focuses on defensive techniques.
  * Useful for threat intelligence, detection, and response planning
